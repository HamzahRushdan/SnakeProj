# SnakeProj
This Python code is a basic implementation of the classic "Snake" game using the Turtle graphics library. In the game, a snake moves around the screen, controlled by arrow keys, and tries to eat randomly generated pieces of "fruit." The objective is to grow the snake by eating fruit while avoiding collisions with the border of the screen and itself. The score is displayed at the top of the screen, increasing each time the snake eats a piece of fruit. The game ends when the snake collides with the border or itself, and the final score is displayed. The code handles the game mechanics, collision detection, and scoring logic within a while loop that continually updates the game's state.


This is my third project in Python using Pycharm. Initially it took me a while to set up git but here we are. I hope you enjoy!
